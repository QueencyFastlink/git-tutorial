        <h1>Git and GitHub</h1>
        <p>GitHub is a cloud-based platform that uses the version control system Git to allow developers to store,
            manage,
            and share code. It facilitates collaboration on software projects by providing a central place for teams to
            track changes, review code, and manage tasks. GitHub can be used for both public and private projects and
            includes tools for issue tracking, project management, and other features that make it a complete platform
            for
            software development.</p>
